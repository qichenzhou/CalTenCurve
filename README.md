# CalTenCurve

This matlab code is used to process stress-strain curve. It can calculate Young's modulus, strength, breaking strain and toughness.

How to use it?  
Please read the PDF documentation ‘How to use CalTenCurve’.

Where is the results?  
The results are saved in different cells in MATLAB. 
Young's Modulus --> Total_Youngs  
strength --> Total_strength  
breaking strain --> Total_breaking_strain  
toughness --> Total_toughness
