# CalTenCurve

This matlab code is used to process strandard stress-strain curve. It can calculate Young's modulus, strength, breaking strain and toughness.

Where is the results?
The results are saved in different column vectors in MATLAB. The coordinates of the results in the column vectors are the same as the number of the data files.

Young's Modulus --> Total_Youngs
strength --> Total_strength
breaking strain --> Total_breaking_strain
toughness --> Total_toughness
